# Advent Of Code 2020

Here are my solutions for the [advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) 
in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) language.

## What is Advent Of Code ?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) is an Advent calendar of small 
programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved 
in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

## About repo structure
I used [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) as package/project manager.
Basically all the code is in
```
day_digit/project_name/src/project_name/core.clj
```


Also i put answers **only in**
```
day_digit/project_name/answer.edn
```

So rest of the project is **spoiler free**.
